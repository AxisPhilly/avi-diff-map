This is the repo for the [AVI Map](http://apps.axisphilly.org/avi-change). Read about how we made it on our [News Apps blog](http://axisphillyapps.tumblr.com).

We developed a barebones template for making full-screen maps, which is available [here](https://github.com/AxisPhilly/fullscreen-map-template).
